## Event-Triggered Adaptive Neural Control for Full State-constrained Nonlinear Systems With Unknown Disturbances Ôºà06/2022-06/2023Ôºâ Research Group Leader 
**Project Source**: Project for Innovation Training Program for College Students (National-level Project)  

**Project Information**: 
1. This project aims to develop an event-sampling immune adaptive controller based on a hybrid event-triggering mechanism to resist unknown external dynamic disturbances and tries to apply the theoretical achievements to practical control scenarios such as UAV swarms or intelligent cart swarms.
2. Ascertain the research topic with the supervisor, which is to add a perturbation observer, a second-order filter, and an event trigger to a state-constrained nonlinear system, refer to extensive literature regarding these models, and add them to a nonlinear complex system to test the operability for further simulation experiments.
3. This project is funded up to **23,200 RMB**, and it is awarded outstanding completion.


## Research on Tracking Control of High-order Nonlinear Multiagent Systems  Ôºà06/2021-06/2022Ôºâ Member  
**Project Source**: Project for Innovation Training Program for College Students (Municipal-level Project)

**Project Information**: 
1. This project investigated the semi-strict feedback system with one pilot and multiple followers existing in consistency control by introducing filters into the higher-order nonlinear multi-intelligent semi-strict feedback system to reduce the complexity and improve the reliability and safety of the system, and designing the unknown disturbance observer to handle the unknown disturbance term. This project is a municipal-level project with a fund of **3000 RMB** and a dissertation published, i.e. the first publication on the PUBLICATION column.
2. Responsible for data collection, data processing, word processing, part of simulation experimental tasks, and paper composing.
