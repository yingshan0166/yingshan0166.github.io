**Project Source**: Project for Innovation Training Program for College Students (Municipal-level Project)

**Project Information**: 
1. This project investigated the semi-strict feedback system with one pilot and multiple followers existing in consistency control by introducing filters into the higher-order nonlinear multi-intelligent semi-strict feedback system to reduce the complexity and improve the reliability and safety of the system, and designing the unknown disturbance observer to handle the unknown disturbance term. This project is a municipal-level project with a fund of **3000 RMB** and a dissertation published, i.e. the first publication on the PUBLICATION column.
